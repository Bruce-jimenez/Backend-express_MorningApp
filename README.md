https://morning-app-be.onrender.com/breakfast - This one is for the Breakfast database 

https://morning-app-be.onrender.com/wake - This one is for the Wake Up log Database

These are the ones only used in this application due to the time constraints and scale of the project idea
## Introduction
This backend in the beginning was supposed to be a tree where the sub databases connect to the 
database and input information from the main database handing info to the sub databases. However that is not the case because time constraints and the idea was too vague in a sense and was not executed properly. As such just made the databases into two seperate pile of information in MongoDB.

# Technologies Used
- dotenv
- express
- mongoDB
- javascript
- cors
